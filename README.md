SHORT DESCRIPTION:

Adding a hidden layer to improve representation learning and visualizing reconstructed test data. The process was repeated with a denoising autoencoder for noise reduction evaluation. Additionally, using the training history, loss and accuracy plots were generated to track model performance over epochs, providing insights into training dynamics and improvements. These exercises aimed to deepen understanding of autoencoder applications in data reconstruction and representation learning.
